## All Students

Once all students have been added as collaborators, clone the repository down to your local machines.

1. Navigate your terminal to the `block03` folder in `coursework`.
2. Clone the `github-workflow` repository down.
3. `ls` should now show a new `github-workflow` directory.
4. Open the `github-workflow` folder in VS Code.
