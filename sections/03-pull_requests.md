# Pull Requests

Now that you've worked on your own feature, how do you share your code with your team? You make a **pull request**!

All students should follow these next steps.

## Create a pull request

1. Run `git push -u origin feature-X` to push the changes to a _remote_ branch, replacing `X` with your letter.
2. In your browser, navigate to the main repository page on GitHub.
3. Go to the **Pull requests** tab.

7. Add a title and description for your pull request. This is usually a brief summary of what you worked on. In this case, you can write something along the lines of "Completed feature X".

8. Click the **Create pull request** button.

## Review a pull request

You will be able to see all pull requests when you navigate to the **Pull requests** tab. The next step in the process is for someone to review the open pull requests.

4. Confirm that `feature-A` has been merged into `main` by navigating back to the repo's **Code** page. The `README` should now contain the text that Student A added.
