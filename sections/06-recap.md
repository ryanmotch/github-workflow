# Recap

Whenever you work on a project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo down to your local machine.
2. Create a local feature branch.
3. Make changes in the branch.
4. Once you're done with your changes, update your main branch and merge it into your feature branch.
5. Push to a remote feature branch and make a pull request.
6. Once the pull request is approved, you can merge in your remote feature branch.
7. Delete your remote and local feature branches.

These are the same exact steps that professional software engineers follow when working on a project with others! Now that you've completed the workshop, you're one step closer to being a professional software engineer yourself.
